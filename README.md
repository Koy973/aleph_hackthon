# Aleph Hackathon

In this project, we are presenting a decentralized platform that combines the functionalities of "Hugging Face" and Google Colab. Our focus is on addressing the issues of dataset security, decentralized computing power, and creating a marketplace for model shareability.

## Problem Statement

In the realm of AI and machine learning, accessing and training models with sensitive datasets while ensuring security is a significant challenge. Additionally, leveraging ample computing power for model training can be costly and inefficient. Furthermore, sharing trained models and accessing them securely is another bottleneck in the current landscape. Our project aims to tackle these challenges head-on by offering a decentralized solution.

## Features Breakdown

### Secure Dataset Upload
- We enable secure dataset uploads via [Aleph.im](http://aleph.im) decentralized storage. This ensures that sensitive data remains secure and accessible only to authorized users.

### Decentralized Model Training
- Utilizing decentralized GPU power, we facilitate model training without the need for centralized computing resources. This approach enhances scalability and reduces the cost associated with model training.

### Shareable Output Models
- Users can share output models securely with others using a unique access_token and UUID. This ensures that only authorized individuals can access the trained models. Moreover, users have the opportunity to monetize their models based on usage.

### Decentralized Marketplace (Paid Service)
- Similar to "Hugging Face," we offer a decentralized marketplace where users can discover and access verified models for a fee. This marketplace fosters collaboration and innovation within the AI community.

### Rewards System
- To incentivize participation and contribution, each user receives rewards in Aleph tokens based on the usage of their models. These tokens can be utilized to access more computing power or traded within the ecosystem.

## Key Considerations

### Security
- Security is paramount in our platform. We employ robust encryption and authentication mechanisms to safeguard datasets and models from unauthorized access.

### Speed
- We prioritize speed in all aspects of our platform, from dataset uploads to model training and inference. By leveraging decentralized computing resources, we ensure fast and efficient operations.

### UI/UX
- A user-friendly interface is essential for widespread adoption. We focus on creating an intuitive and visually appealing user experience to enhance usability and accessibility.
